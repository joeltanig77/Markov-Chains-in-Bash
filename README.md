# Markov Chains in Bash

This program takes a file and an integer argument (for words to print) and predicts the next word based on the text file that is generated by markov-words.sh. If the shuffle program is not supported on your os, no need to fear as this project provides one for you.
## Running the project 


Running markov-words.sh:

```
$./markov-words.sh < [FILE] > [NEWTEXTFILE]
```
Example:
```
$ ./markov-words.sh < textFile.txt > translatedText.txt
```
Running markov-sentence.sh:
```
$./markov-sentence.sh [FILE][INT]
```
Example: 
```
$./markov-sentence.sh textFile.txt 400 | fold -w 80 -s
```
## What each file does
markov-words.sh: 

Takes a textfile and creates a new text file that is formatted so markov-sentence.sh can read the file properly. 

markov-sentence.sh:

Picks three words randomly by the text file generated by markov-words.sh and will predict the next word using the Markov algorithm. It will then keep printing until the number of words requested is by the user is printed and in this example, listed at 400 words.
